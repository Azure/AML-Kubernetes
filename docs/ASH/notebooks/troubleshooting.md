# Trouble Shooting for Training Using AzureML with Azure Stack Hub Kubernetes Cluster and Storage

## Issues Related to Dataset and Datastore

1. Known limitation:
   Tabular datasets are not supported by datastore in AzureML workspace connected to ASH storage
   
2. If data cannot be uploaded to datastore, check if sas token for ASH storage container expired or not.

## Issues Related to ASH Kubernetes Clusters

1. If attach ASH Kubernetes clusters to AzureML workspace failed, check ARC connection, and pods in azure-arc namespace.
   
2. For Distributed Training, make sure you have enough nodes.
   You can check if pods are scheduled or not, reasons why pods are not able to schedule by running kubectl commands:
   

   ---
     kubectl describe pod/pod_id
   ---
3. If training is successful for one epoch but not for multiple epochs, try to increase memory.

## AzureML Run Issues

These issues are relative easy to debug. You can go to AzureML run logs to check image creation, run time errors, 
outputs generated by your scripts etc to pinpoint the problems.

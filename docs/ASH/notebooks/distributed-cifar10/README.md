# Distributed Training on Azure Stack Hub Kubernetes Cluster and Storage Account

These sample notebooks guide you through a distributed training workload that trains an ML model on [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset hosted on ASH Storage. We offer two notebooks taking advantage of the most popular deep learning frameworks PyTorch and Tensorflow.

## Notebooks

* [Distributed Image Classification with PyTorch](distributed-pytorch-cifar10.ipynb)
* [Distributed Image Classification with Tensorflow](distributed-tf2-cifar10.ipynb)

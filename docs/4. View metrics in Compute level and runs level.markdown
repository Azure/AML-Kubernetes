For Data Scientists, job(run) level monitoring and reporting during training import to them, it can help them to:

•	Understand the performance of their training script (does the job fully used capacity of GPUs, CPUs, what is the throughput of this model etc.)
•	Find the bottleneck of this training job(run), GPU Memory, network etc.
•	Better understand to different training parameters impact their job (batch size, epoch, learning rate etc.)

For Admin, compute level monitor and reporting are important, it can help them to:

•	Optimized quota(resource) allocation strategy
•	Understand the utilization of resource

## Enable custom metrics 

CMAKS use application insights of AML worksapce to show the metrics of compute level and run level. To enable this function, you need enable custom metrics in ```appinsights>config>usage & estimated cost> custom metrics```.

After AML agnet is sucessful installed, you can [attach CMAKS compute](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Samples/blob/master/docs/2.%20Attach%20CMAKS%20compute.markdown)


## Install Metric UX locally

### Prerequisite
This project needs you have installed following things in your local machine.
1. Nodejs  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Azure cli https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest

### Install metrics UX

1. Please unzip the [demo.zip](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Sample/raw/master/files/demo.zip)

2. Delete build document and unzip [build.zip](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Sample/raw/master/files/build.zip) into demo folder.

3. Then run “start.bat”

After you see this window, you can go to http://localhost:3000/selectWorkspace?flight=computeMetrics, and select the workspace.

### View compute level metrics

To view the CMKAKS compute level metrics, you can go to `attached compute > compute detail > Monitoring`. Note, only CMAKS compute target support this page.

### View run level metrics

To view the CMKAKS run level metrics, you can use to two workflow:
1. `compute detail > runs > Monitoring`
2. `experiment > runs > Monitoring`

## Useful chart toolkit
We provide some useful functions in the charts:
- Zoom: Zoom time range, mouse drag and drop on the charts 
- Pan: change the time range through pan the x axis
- Reset Axes: Reset axes to default value, double click on the chart
- Switch Chart type: switch the chart type between bar chart and line chart
- Select/unselect legends: click on the legend will select or unselect legend
- Only select one legend: double click on one selected legend will only show the data of this legend, this is very helpful if you have many legend on the chart.

## Using CMAKS Compute in AML sample notebooks

In this tutorial, we will give a list of AML jobs that CMAKS supported by now.
All of the supported notebooks in [AML notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) has been modified to use CMAKS compute and included in this repo under [sample_notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks). 
You can try these notebooks according to your scenarios.

### Not supported AML job

- ParallelRunStep: CMAKS didn't support batch inference using ParallelRunStep yet. 
    - [parallel-run](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks/005%20pipeline/parallel-run)
    - [pipeline-parallel-run](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks/005%20pipeline/pipeline-style-transfer/pipeline-style-transfer-parallel-run.ipynb)  

### Supported AML job

- [single node job](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks/002%20single%20node%20job): learn how to build and submit a single-node training job to CMAKS compute. 
- [distributed job](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks/003%20distribute%20job): learn how to build and submit a distributed training job under different frameworks to CMAKS compute.

# Image Classification Using Scikit-learn

Using MNIST as an example, this sample notebook demonstrates how to train a machine learning model using AKS-HCI Arc compute and an on-premise NFS Server. Training data is stored on on-premise NFS Server. The register the trained model and deploy that on the AKS-HCI Arc compute for inference.

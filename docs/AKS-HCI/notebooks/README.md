# Sample Notebooks

After following the setup documents, you can go through the sample notebooks linked below to get a better understanding of how the process works and the possibilities it can unlock:

## Notebooks

* [Image Classification Using Scikit-learn](mnist/MNIST_Training_with_AKS-HCI_Cluster_and_NFS.ipynb) (Image Classification, Aprox. 20 Minutes)

  This notebook serves as "hello world" of using for training and inference with AKS-HCI Cluster, on-premise NFS Server and Azure Machine Learning workspaces. Estimated run time for the notebook is 20 minutes, including
  * Training with AKS-HCI cluster and on-premise NFS Server
  * Register model
  * Inference with registered model on AKS-HCI cluster
  * Test model

Note: Above run time estimated assume a vm size comparable to [Standard_DS3_v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-general)

# Distributed Training on AKS-HCI and on-premise NFS Server

These sample notebooks guide you through a distributed training workload that trains an ML model on [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset hosted on on-premise NFS Server. We offer two notebooks taking advantage of the most popular deep learning frameworks PyTorch and Tensorflow.

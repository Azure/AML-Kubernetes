# Azure Machine Learning notebooks

In this tutorial, we will give a list of the [AML notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) that can be modified to use AMLK8s as compute. 
All of the supported notebooks has been included in this repo under [sample_notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks). 
You can try these notebooks according to your scenarios.

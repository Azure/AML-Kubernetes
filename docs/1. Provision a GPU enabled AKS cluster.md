## Provision AKS clusters
To fully use CMASK compute, you need first provision a GPU cluster, your can create a AKS via [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell), [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal), and [using ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-rm-template). You can refer [AKS documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) to get more detail informantions.

## GPU VM size

In Azure the VM size begining with "N" indicate this VM is a GPU SKU, and you can find detail GPU VM size at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu

#### Currently, AKS supports the NC and ND series of GPU's. You can view the list of supported GPU's when you create an AKS cluster in the portal and view all SKU's supported when you select 'Change Size' in the Node Size picker.

## View Cluste level Monitoring

You can enable the AZ monitor for container follow the instructions: [Azure Monitor for containers overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-overview?toc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Faks%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json)

After that you can find cluster monitering info under AKS monitoring > insights.

If you provion a GPU enbled Clutser, you can also view the GPU proformence from GPU workbooks.

After you created a GPU enabled AKS cluter you can go to [attach CMAKS compute](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Samples/blob/master/docs/2.%20Attach%20CMAKS%20compute.markdown).

We use AML add-on to bring your AKS cluster to AML workspace, if you want to know more detail about AML add-on, please goto [managed AML add-on](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Samples/blob/master/docs/5.%20Manage%20AML%20add-on.markdown)
